# TheLibrary

This project was completed as part of The Odin Project. In addition to basic functionality, I have added the following: an overlay to display the form, a second overlay that displays additional data related to the book, an option to edit the books data, responsiveness, and additional validation of data including checking if the book already exists in the library and full data validation that is performed in JavaScript.
